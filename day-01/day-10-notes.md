## What I learned today

- How to create and switch branches
- How to work safely outside main
- How to merge a branch back into main

## Commands practiced
- git branch
- git switch
- git merge

## Key concepts
- main represents the stable production branch
- Branches allow safe experimentation
- Work should be done on branches, not directly on main
- Merging brings tested changes back into main

## Problems I faced

Day 10 Key Points

- A branch is a separate line of development
- main is the stable production branch
- New work should be done on a branch
- git switch changes between branches
- git merge brings branch work into main
- Branches can be safely deleted after merging

Workflow today:
- Create branch
- Switch to branch
- Commit work
- Switch to main
- Merge branch
- Push to GitHub
- Delete branch

This is how professionals work safely.
