# Day 11 - Merge Conflicts & Recovery

## What I learned today
- Why merge conflicts happen
- How Git shows conflicts in files
- How to resolve conflicts safely
- How to commit a resolved merge
- How to keep main branch stable

## Commands practiced
- git branch
- git switch
- git add
- git commit
- git merge
- git push

## Key concepts
- Conflicts happen when two branches edit the same lines
- HEAD represents the current branch
- Use markers <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>> to find conflicts
- Always resolve before committing merge
- Deleting experiment branches keeps repo clean

## Problems I faced
- Merge conflict occurs intentionally
- File content must be resolved manually

## Fixes / Notes
- Always check git status
- After resolving, git add marks file as resolved
- Commit merges after resolution
