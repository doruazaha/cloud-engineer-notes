# Day 21 — Cron Automation & Log Rotation

## Goal
Automate system health checks and prevent uncontrolled log growth.

## Key Concepts
- Cron scheduling
- Non-interactive execution
- Log growth risks
- Manual log rotation
- System hygiene

## What I built
- Hourly automated health checks
- Daily health log rotation

## Lessons learned
- Cron requires absolute paths
- Scripts must be fully self-contained
- Logs must be managed or they become a liability
- Automation without monitoring is dangerous
