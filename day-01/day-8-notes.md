# Day 8 - Local Git Workflow

## What I learned today
- How to create and track a new file with Git
- How to check repository status
- How to commit changes locally

## Commands Practiced

- pwd
- ls -a
- git status 
- git add
- git commit
- git log

## Key concepts
- Git tracks changes in files
- Nothing is saved in history until you commit
- Local commits are safe even without GitHub

# I can create, stage, and commit a file without help

## Day 8 key points 
- A git Workflow is: edit-> git status->git add->git commit
-Untracked file = Git sees it but is not tracking it
- Staged file = ready to be commited
- Commit = saved permanently in local history
- git status shows the truth of the repository state
- Git log shows all past commits

Today I practiced:
-Creating a new notes file
-Staging it with git add
-Saving it with git commit
-Viewing history with git log

I can now manage local Git without GitHub.
